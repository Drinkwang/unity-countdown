**You have a Unity Pro with beautiful dark theme? Don't worry dark theme is also supported!**

Have you ever attend a Hackathon or GameJam event with Unity?

Use this plugin to keep your time count!



## Usage
### Install
1. Download the .unitypackage file and import it into your project. 
2. Done!

### Customize
Since your time is important, I designed this to be extremely easy to use.

All settings can be done just in Unity's preference menu. 
If you can open this menu, you can customize!!
